# Cafe Order Application - Mini Project
This program will allow you to create, update and delete products, couriers and orders from a list of dictionaries whilst saving the data given.

## Project Background
The client required an app that they could use for their pop-up coffee shop. We were being provided the requirements for the application on a weekly basis. The aim was to create a software application that helps them log and track orders.

## Weekly Requirements

- [ ] Week 1
  ``` 
  As a user I want to:
  create a product and add it to a list
  view all products
  STRETCH update or delete a product
  ```

- [ ] Week 2
  ```
  As a user I want to:
  create a product or order and add it to a list
  view all products or orders
  STRETCH I want to be able to update or delete a product or orde
  ```
  
- [ ] Week 3
  ```
  As a user I want to:
  create a product, courier, or order and add it to a list
  view all products, couriers, or orders
  update the status of an order
  persist my data (products and couriers)
  STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier
  ```
  
- [ ] Week 4
  ```
  To show that our code works, we will also need to write unit tests to prove that
  our app works correctly.
  
  As a user I want to:
  create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list
  view all products, couriers, or orders
  update the status of an order
  persist my data
  STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier
  BONUS list orders by status or courier
  ```
## Design 
Starting this project being a beginner and evolving into a more proficient coder, I realised my design changed a lot during the process. Receiving new requirements for the project on a weekly basis ensured I had to constantly change my code and make it simpler through refactoring. This was done by creating a file which contains the main functions I'd be using throughout the application.     

## Project Requirements 
During the course of the project, flexibility was required to ensure the requirements were met. Refactoring the code, rewriting functions and looking for new ways to meet the requirements were essential for this and were pursued consistently.

## Project Improvements
Due to time constraints I was unable to finish off my testing. This would have allowed me to gain a higher quality and more efficient code. With more time I'd like to implement week 5 and 6 of the clients spec but, with the current iteration of the program it would greatly benefit from implementing try-except blocks for when the user is asked to enter a value requiring a certain datatype. There is also future room to expand this project to be linked to a database as our client expands their business.

I would consider refactoring and taking an object-orientated approach. This may make the process of refactoring the code to implement the use of a database much more feasible.

## Project Implementation
I enjoyed making my code look neater by implementing different colours for certain menu inputs. It also was fun to learn how to write a programme that meets the given specifications and to see how it runs when you have no prior knowledge of the field.
