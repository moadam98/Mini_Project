# Cafe Order Application - Mini Project
This program will allow you to create, update and delete products, couriers and orders from a list of dictionaries whilst saving the data given.

## Project Background
The client required an app that they could use for their pop-up coffee shop. We were being provided the requirements for the application on a weekly basis. The aim was to create a software application that helps them log and track orders.

## Design 
Starting this project being a beginner and evolving into a more proficient coder, I realised my design changed a lot during the process. Receiving new requirements for the project on a weekly basis ensured I had to constantly change my code and make it simpler through refactoring. This was done by creating a file which contains the main functions I'd be using throughout the application.     

## Project Requirements 
During the course of the project, flexibility was required to ensure the requirements were met. Refactoring the code, rewriting functions and looking for new ways to meet the requirements were essential for this and were pursued consistently.

## Project Improvements
Due to time constraints I was unable to finish off my testing. This would have allowed me to gain a higher quality and more efficient code. I'd also like to implement week 5 and 6 into the program.

## Project Implementation
I enjoyed making my code look neater by implementing different colours for certain menu inputs.
